# Add your custom environment configuration here
# Note: Sway doesn't support env directives like Hyprland
# Set environment variables in ~/.profile or via systemd user environment
# You can use exec_always for runtime settings

# Example: Set custom environment for launched applications
# exec_always systemctl --user import-environment DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY SWAYSOCK
